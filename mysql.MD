# MySQL

Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

**Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer.**

**You can list modules by using "dnf module list"**
```
dnf module list
```

Install MySQL Server 8.0.x

```
dnf install mysql-server -y
```

Start MySQL Service

```
systemctl enable mysqld
```
```
systemctl start mysqld
```

Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password ExpenseApp@1 or any other as per your choice.

```
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1
```
That's all



Verification:

We can check data by using client package called mysql.

Usually command to connect mysql server is
```
mysql -h db.lingaiah.online -u root -pExpenseApp@1
```
But if your client and server both are in a single server, you can simply issue.
```
mysql
```
Once you got mysql prompt, you can use below command to check schemas/databases exist.
```
show databases;
```

First load the backend.sql schema and run the below commands.
Once you are in particular schema, you can get the list of tables.
```
show tables;
```
You can get entries of a table using
```
select * from transactions;
```
